This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been initialized or updated.  This often happens inside of a component's render method before the component has fully mounted or when dealing with asynchronous operations.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage leading to undefined prop or state
function MyComponent({ myProp }) {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{myProp.someValue}</Text> {/* Error if myProp is undefined or null */}
    </View>
  );
}
```
